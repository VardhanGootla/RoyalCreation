              <strong>Sustainable & Eco-Friendly Decor:</strong> Embrace biodegradable materials, reusable elements, 
              and locally sourced florals. Couples are increasingly choosing eco-conscious options that minimize 
              environmental impact without compromising on elegance.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Mixed Metallics:</strong> Move beyond single metal themes. Combine gold, silver, bronze, and 
              copper elements for a sophisticated, layered look that adds depth and visual interest to your decor.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Bold Color Palettes:</strong> While pastels remain popular, rich jewel tones like emerald green, 
              sapphire blue, and amethyst purple are making a strong comeback for those wanting to make a dramatic statement.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Textured Fabrics:</strong> Velvet, silk, and linen are being used extensively for table runners, 
              chair covers, and drapery. These textures add luxury and warmth to any event space.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Organic & Asymmetrical Arrangements:</strong> Floral arrangements are moving away from perfect 
              symmetry towards more natural, garden-style designs that feel fresh, wild, and effortlessly beautiful.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Statement Ceiling Decor:</strong> Don't ignore the overhead space. Hanging installations, 
              fabric draping, and floral chandeliers are transforming ordinary venues into extraordinary spaces.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Personalized & Custom Elements:</strong> From monogrammed decor to custom illustrations, 
              personal touches that reflect the couple's story are becoming central to event design.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Vintage & Antique Accents:</strong> Incorporating family heirlooms, vintage furniture, 
              and antique decorative pieces adds character and tells a richer story than all-new decor.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Interactive Lighting:</strong> Beyond basic uplighting, dynamic LED installations, 
              projection mapping, and interactive light displays are creating immersive experiences for guests.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Minimalist Elegance:</strong> For those who prefer understated sophistication, 
              clean lines, neutral palettes, and strategic negative space create powerful visual impact 
              through simplicity rather than abundance.
