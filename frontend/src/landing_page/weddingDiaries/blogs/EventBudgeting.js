              <strong>Determine Your Total Budget:</strong> Start by establishing the maximum amount you're willing to spend. Be honest about what you can afford and commit to staying within this limit.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Identify Your Non-Negotiables:</strong> Choose your top 3 priorities (venue, catering, photography, etc.). These cornerstone elements deserve the largest portion of your budget.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Research Average Costs:</strong> Investigate current market rates for venues, vendors, and services in your area. This research prevents unrealistic expectations and helps with negotiations.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Create Detailed Categories:</strong> Break down your budget into specific categories: Venue & Rental (25-30%), Catering & Bar (30-35%), Photography & Videography (10-15%), Attire & Beauty (5-10%), Entertainment (5-10%), Decor & Flowers (5-10%), Stationery (2-3%), Transportation (2-3%), and Emergency Fund (10-15%).
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Track Every Expense:</strong> Use digital tools like spreadsheets or budgeting apps to record all deposits, payments, and receipts. Regular updates keep you on track.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Negotiate with Vendors:</strong> Don't hesitate to ask for package deals, off-season discounts, or custom packages. Most vendors are willing to work within reasonable budgets.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Plan for Hidden Costs:</strong> Remember to include often-overlooked expenses like taxes, service charges, gratuities, delivery fees, and potential overtime charges.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Set Up a Payment Schedule:</strong> Coordinate deposit due dates with your income schedule to avoid financial strain. Spread major payments across multiple months when possible.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Review and Adjust Regularly:</strong> Revisit your budget monthly and make necessary adjustments. Be prepared to prioritize and cut non-essential items if needed.
            </li>
            <li className="list-group-item">
              <strong>Use Budgeting Tools:</strong> Leverage event planning apps, templates, or professional software designed specifically for event budgeting and management.
